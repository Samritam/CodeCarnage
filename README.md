### Mac and Other Devices

Mac and Other Devices are not directly supported by CodeCarnage.

If you cannot access a Linux Device, we recommend using a Virtual Environment with Fedora, as this is a tested environment.
To do this, see http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Fedora-17-in-Virtualbox (while the article is slightly outdated, the procedure is extremely similar).

You could also try to follow the **Linux** instructions at your own risk.
