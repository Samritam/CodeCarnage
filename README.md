# CodeCarnage
An intuitive and simple arena battle game involving strategy.

## Who?
Sean Brais, Jacob Ekstrum, Nick Martin, and David Olsen.

## What?
CodeCarnage is an arena battle game where each side indirectly controls a robot. The robot is manipulated through a custom script that the user creates through a drag-and-drop interface, allowing infinite customization.

### Is there more?

CodeCarnage intends on adding more features, including the ability to interact with the environment during the arena matchups to tilt the battle in favor of the user's robot. As the game develops, other intended features will be listed here.

Contributions are always welcome!
