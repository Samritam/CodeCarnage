## How To Play

### Prerequisites

You will need **git** (to clone our repository) and **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) v1.8 (or greater)** (to run the game).

#### How to Install git

Please see https://git-scm.com/downloads for more information.

#### How to Install The Java Runtime Environment

You likely already have the *Java Runtime Environment* installed on your machine and will not need to download this package.

However, should you have difficulties running *CodeCarnage*, please see https://java.com/en/download/ .

### Windows

1. Clone our git repository (if you are unsure how to clone a git repository, please see https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ .)
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the git repository (this path will end with *CodeCarnage*).
3. Double-click the ***CodeCarnage-all.jar*** file.
4. Play!

### Linux and Mac

1. Clone our git repository (if you are unsure how to clone a git repository, please see https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ .)
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the git repository via a terminal window and type the following command:
    
        java -jar CodeCarnage-all.jar
3. Play!

### Other Devices

If you cannot access a Linux Device, we recommend using a Virtual Environment with Fedora, as this is a tested environment.
To do this, see http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Fedora-17-in-Virtualbox (while the article is slightly outdated, the procedure is extremely similar).

You could also try to follow the **Linux and Mac** instructions at your own risk.
